# FAQ

## Why should I use this framework?

If you want to create your own gamemode, and you need a starting point, this framework is perfect for you. It contains our experience as Software Developers and our definition of modularity. If you are looking for a plug & play system, you are completely wrong with this. If you want to teach yourself to next level of development with [alt:V](https://altv.mp/#/) or TypeScript, this will be perfect for you.

## How much does the framework cost?

Good news! Nothing. The complete framework is free and open source. We respect the work of [alt:V](https://altv.mp/#/) and want to give a little piece back.

## Is this a complete runnable gamemode like RP?

No, this is only a framework that helps you to write your own gamemode. We will create an example gamemode to show you the benefits of using this framework, and we write our own gamemode within.

## Is this like ESX for fiveM?

No, we don't have any kind of external plugin system at this point. Our goal is not to create a system of plug & play. We want to improve the code quality for each gamemode written in TypeScript.

## I am missing some features. Can you implement it?

Of course! We can implement base features for the core system, but we won't implement specific gamemode features like an inventory or a job system for RP servers. This has to be done by yourself.  
If you have any idea or feature request, please join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DcpsfkVkfb) and share it.

## I don't understand anything do you provide custom support?

Before you start using this framework, you need knowledge about TypeScript. Without this knowledge you won't able to understand the main benefits of this system.

If you teach yourself with TypeScript and anything is confusing, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DcpsfkVkfb) and ask your questions.

## Is there any place where I can find some scripts/snippets/recipes?

Yes it is planned, but at first release of this Framework this section won't be completed or fulfilled. We will publish snippets/scripts/recipes that you can use in your gamemode which will work with the framework. If there is a cool idea, we will integrate the idea directly into our core system. Keep your eyes on the sidebar **Recipes**, **Snippets**, **Scripts** or our _\*\*_[Discord](https://discord.gg/DcpsfkVkfb).
